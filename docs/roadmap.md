# ticker-due-diligence-cli Roadmap

This roadmap keeps the CLI focused on fast, local-first ticker diligence. Each phase should ship with tests, README updates, and no live-data dependency unless explicitly called out.

## Phase 1 — Input quality gates

**Status:** Shipped

**Goal:** Make bad or incomplete local research inputs obvious before the generated note is treated as useful.

**Shipped scope:**

- Added structured input validation issues with `severity`, `path`, and `message` fields.
- Added input quality issues to the JSON score profile under `input_quality_issues`.
- Added `--validate-only` CLI mode that exits non-zero when blocking errors are present and prints a machine-readable validation report.
- Added an `Input quality` section to Markdown notes so incomplete assumptions are visible.
- Covered the feature with unit and CLI smoke tests while keeping the implementation dependency-light.

## Phase 2 — Comparable company context

**Status:** Planned

**Goal:** Let users add a small local peer table so the note can flag relative growth, margin, leverage, and valuation context without fetching live market data.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Accept a local peers CSV or inline JSON peer list.
- Normalize common peer metrics and report missing columns clearly.
- Add a peer-context section to Markdown and JSON outputs.
- Include examples and tests for high-growth/high-leverage and margin-lagging cases.

## Phase 3 — Catalyst calendar and forcing-event tracking

**Status:** Planned

**Goal:** Turn catalysts into dated forcing events with watch windows and stale-event warnings.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Accept catalyst objects with optional `date`, `source`, and `expected_signal` fields while preserving the current string-list shape.
- Sort dated catalysts and flag events that are stale or undated.
- Add a Markdown forcing-event table and JSON catalyst timeline.
- Add tests for mixed dated and undated catalysts.

## Phase 4 — Source and evidence traceability

**Status:** Planned

**Goal:** Help users distinguish sourced observations from placeholders or unsupported assertions.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Accept optional `sources` and per-field evidence references.
- Add source coverage summary to JSON and Markdown outputs.
- Warn when high-impact risks, catalysts, or KPIs have no source.
- Keep external fetching out of scope; source metadata remains user-supplied.

## Phase 5 — Batch watchlist scoring

**Status:** Planned

**Goal:** Run the same diligence heuristic across multiple local ticker inputs and produce a ranked watchlist.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Accept a directory of ticker JSON files.
- Emit Markdown and JSON summary tables sorted by score and risk.
- Keep per-ticker note generation available.
- Add tests for partial failures so one bad ticker does not hide the full batch result.
